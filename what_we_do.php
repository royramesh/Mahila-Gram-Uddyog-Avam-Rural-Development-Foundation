                    <p>Mahila Gram UddyogAvam Rural Development Foundation is a non-profit, non-government, and non-religious voluntary organization operating in the rural, urban, tribal and far-flung habitations of southwest regions of Uttar Pradesh. Its origin owes to a dream once seen by some likeminded intellectuals, educationists, doctors, engineers and social-activist youths who firmly believe that India cannot be translated into a developed country until a sustainable holistic transformation of its rural sector takes place.</p>
